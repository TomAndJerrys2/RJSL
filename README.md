# a Random JavaScript Library

RJSL is a library that is used by a few of my other pet projects and is used solely
to compute data structures and algorithms efficiently in JavaScript. While, to some
this might seem ridiculous. But it was more about the learning and implentation that
I was driven towards - rather than being concerned about "re-inventing the wheel"

This Library has a number of features, some bespoke - most are common functions, classes
and Objects that you would most likely see implemented in most of today's modern languages
and frameworks.
